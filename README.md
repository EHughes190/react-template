## React Template

This is a basic template for a react application that doesn't use Create React App, meaning it's more lightweight and less 'fluffy'.

Note the use of ts-loader to transpile typescript. You can use @babel/preset-typescript instead if already using babel, but contrary to ts-loader, the underlying @babel/plugin-transform-typescript plugin does not perform any type checking. https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/
